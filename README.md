# 168-L-Arrays-
I created a simple website about studio Ghibli's animated films and highlighted the plot of their classic film, "Spirited Away". In Javascript, I added two new variables and used two Mutator Methods .push() and .pop(). Then, I used two accesor methods .concat() and .includes(), and added two new variable arrays to store them.
