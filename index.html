<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p> This film is about the main protagonist Chihiro, a 10 year old japanese girl Chihiro drives with her parents towards their new home and takes a wrong turn into a dense forest leading their car towards the entrance of a seemingly abandoned theme park. 
    Rather than reverse and navigate to their new home, her parents insist on exploring the park despite her anxious disapproval. They reach a town of empty shops and streets with the smell of hot foods alluring them to a stall.
    While her parents decide to help themselves to the food, Chihiro walks around town and finds a bridge connecting the town to the entrance of a running bathhouse. Someone spots her and tells her she must leave.
    Caught by surprise, she rushes back to the stall where her parents are to find they've turned into pigs and their clothing outstretched.
    In the remainder of the film, she's left with no choice but to survive in the spiritual realms she's found herself in, navigating challenges and gaining friends and self-confidence to figure out how to break the spell on her parents.</p>
